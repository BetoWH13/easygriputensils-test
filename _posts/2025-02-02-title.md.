---Arthritis Eating Utensils and Holders

Arthritis Eating Utensils and Arthritis Utensil Holders are designed to help prevent hand pain and allow users to be more independent during meal time.
Silverware with large, soft grip handles and ergonomic designs allow users to feed themselves.
Adapted forks, spoons, and table knives that can be bent or angled allow users suffering from arthritis to experience increased independence when eating. 
Users with arthritis, carpal tunnel or hand injuries often have difficulty maintaining a grip on items due to decreased arm strength.
Arthritis Utensil holders include a variety of grips and unique tools that make holding silverware easier.
